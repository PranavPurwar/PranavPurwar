Check out my website [here](https://invokevirtual.vercel.app)

## Background

There is not much information for me to share here, so, for that, visit the website instead.
Also, apparently (according to github), *I've written over* 7 million Lines of Code (LOC).

I'm often working on [Cosmic-Ide](https://github.com/Cosmic-Ide/Cosmic-Ide).

I have been developing software since the age of 11.

I have en extensive experience with Kotlin, Java and Python.
I usually work on Android App Development, git, bash, zsh, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Intellij Idea, PyCharm and my *own* Cosmic IDE.

I've also been a major contributor to [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) and have gained a lot of knowledge about reverse engineering android apps with it.

Recently, I've been taking some interest in "hacking" or compromising the security of websites as well.
